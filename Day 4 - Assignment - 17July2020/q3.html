      Question 3: Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping.
      <br /><br />So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products
      you want to buy.<br /><br />Now that you are inside of the shop, you have
      a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to add a few
      more.<br /><br />
      Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the
      shoppingList array, and add some new products into it
    </h1>

    <script>
      let shoppingList = [
        "Floor",
        "Cake",
        "tooth paste",
        "shampoo",
        "egg",
        "bread",
      ];

      document.write("Current array shoppingList = " + shoppingList);

      document.write("<br/><br/>adding soap, coke");

      let shoppingBasket = shoppingList.concat(["coke", "soap"]);

      document.write("<br/><br/>New array shoppingbasket = " + shoppingBasket);
